# Movie-Recommendation-System

The Movie Recommendation System is a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file that demonstrates the implementation of a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering. This system suggests movies to users based on their previous ratings and the ratings of similar users.

## Overview
The `Movie-Recommendation-System.ipynb` notebook provides step-by-step instructions and code examples to build and evaluate a movie recommendation system. The notebook covers the following main sections:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: This section focuses on loading the movie rating dataset and performing necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and data cleaning.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Here, the notebook provides insights into the dataset by exploring the distribution of movie ratings, analyzing user behavior, and understanding the characteristics of the movie dataset.

3. **Collaborative Filtering**: This section introduces collaborative filtering as the underlying technique for movie recommendations. It covers both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering algorithms and provides code examples for implementation.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**: The notebook explains common evaluation metrics used for assessing the performance of recommendation systems, including mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).

5. **Movie Recommendation**: This section demonstrates how to utilize the trained recommendation models to generate movie recommendations for a given user. It provides code examples for making personalized movie recommendations based on user ratings and similarity calculations.

6. **Conclusion and Future Enhancements**: The final section summarizes the notebook and suggests potential future enhancements for the movie recommendation system.

## Requirements
To run the `CodeClause-Movie-Recommendation-System.ipynb` notebook, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

It's recommended to set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies before running the notebook.

It is also necessary to download the dataset for the notebook to work as intended. 
The Movies dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle with the help of [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset).

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository containing the `Movie-Recommendation-System.ipynb` notebook to your local machine.
2. Open Jupyter Notebook on your machine.
3. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
4. Open the `Movie-Recommendation-System.ipynb` notebook.
5. Run each code cell sequentially to execute the code and observe the outputs.
6. Read the markdown cells for explanations and instructions on each section of the notebook.
7. Customize and modify the code as needed to experiment with different aspects of the movie recommendation system.
8. Feel free to explore the dataset, tweak the algorithms, and experiment with additional evaluation metrics to enhance the recommendation system's performance.
